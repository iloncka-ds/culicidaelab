| üß© **Extensible & Modular** | The library is designed with modularity in mind, allowing you to easily add your own models or data providers. |

### Practical Applications of the `culicidaelab` Library

-   **Automation in Scientific Laboratories:**
    -   **Bulk Data Processing:** Automatically analyzing thousands of images from camera traps or microscopes to assess mosquito populations without manual labor.
    -   **Reproducibility of Research:** Standardizing the data analysis process, which allows other scientists to easily reproduce and verify research results published using this library.

-   **Integration into Governmental and Commercial Systems:**
    -   **Building Monitoring Systems:** Using the library as the core "engine" for national or regional epidemiological surveillance systems.
    -   **Developing Custom Solutions:** Rapidly prototyping and creating specialized software products for disinsection services, agro-industrial companies, or environmental organizations.

-   **Analytics and Data Science:**
    -   Writing scripts for in-depth data analysis, building distribution maps, and forecasting disease outbreaks based on the presence of vectors.
