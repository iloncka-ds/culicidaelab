`CulicidaeLab` provides a robust, extensible framework designed to streamline the pipeline of mosquito image analysis. Built on a powerful configuration system, it allows researchers and developers to easily manage datasets, experiment with models, and process images for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

## Key Features

- **Configuration-Driven Workflow**: Manage all settingsâ€”from file paths to model parametersâ€”through simple YAML files. Override defaults easily for custom experiments.
- **Ready-to-Use Models**: Leverage pre-trained models for:
    - **Species Classification**: Identify mosquito species using a high-accuracy classifier.
    - **Mosquito Detection**: Localize mosquitoes in images with a YOLO-based detector.
    - **Instance Segmentation**: Generate precise pixel-level masks with a SAM-based segmenter.
- **Unified API**: All predictors share a consistent interface (`.predict()`, `.visualize()`, `.evaluate()`) for a predictable user experience.
- **Automatic Resource Management**: The library intelligently manages local storage, automatically downloading and caching model weights and datasets on first use.
- **Extensible Provider System**: Seamlessly connect to data sources. A `HuggingFaceProvider` is built-in, with an easy-to-implement interface for adding more providers.
- **Powerful Visualization**: Instantly visualize model outputs with built-in, configurable methods for drawing bounding boxes, classification labels, and segmentation masks.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a modern package manager like `uv` or `pip`.

```bash
# Using uv
uv pip install culicidaelab

# Or using pip
pip install culicidaelab
```

## Quick Start

Here's how to classify the species of a mosquito in just a few lines of code. The library will automatically download the necessary model on the first run.

```python
import cv2
from culicidaelab.core import get_settings

# 1. Get the central settings object
# This loads all default configurations for the library.
settings = get_settings()

# 2. Instantiate the classifier
# The settings object knows how to configure the classifier.
classifier = settings.instantiate_from_config("predictors.classifier")

# 3. Load an image
# (Ensure you have an image file at 'path/to/your/image.jpg')
try:
    image = cv2.imread("path/to/your/image.jpg")
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
except (cv2.error, AttributeError):
    print("Error: Could not load image. Please check the file path.")
    exit()

# 4. Make a prediction
# The model is lazy-loaded (downloaded and loaded into memory) here.
with classifier.model_context():
    predictions = classifier.predict(image_rgb)

# 5. Print the results
# The output is a list of (species_name, confidence_score) tuples.
print("Top 3 Predictions:")
for species, confidence in predictions[:3]:
    print(f"- {species}: {confidence:.4f}")

# Example Output:
# Top 3 Predictions:
# - Aedes aegypti: 0.9876
# - Aedes albopictus: 0.0112
# - Culex quinquefasciatus: 0.0009
```

## Going Deeper

`CulicidaeLab` can do much more. You can easily chain predictors, run batch predictions, and visualize results.

```python
# --- Continuing from the Quick Start ---

# Use the detector to find the mosquito first
detector = settings.instantiate_from_config("predictors.detector")
with detector.model_context():
    detections = detector.predict(image_rgb) # Returns [(x, y, w, h, conf)]

# Visualize the detection results
with detector.model_context():
    viz_image = detector.visualize(image_rgb, detections)
    cv2.imwrite("detection_result.png", cv2.cvtColor(viz_image, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR))
```

## Practical Applications

`CulicidaeLab` is more than just a set of models; it's a powerful engine for building real-world solutions. Here are some of the ways it can be applied:

-   **Automation in Scientific Laboratories:**
    -   **Bulk Data Processing:** Automatically analyze thousands of images from camera traps or microscopes to assess mosquito populations without manual intervention.
    -   **Reproducible Research:** Standardize the data analysis process, allowing other scientists to easily reproduce and verify research results published using the library.

-   **Integration into Governmental and Commercial Systems:**
    -   **Epidemiological Surveillance:** Use the library as the core "engine" for national or regional monitoring systems to track vector-borne disease risks.
    -   **Custom Solution Development:** Rapidly prototype and create specialized software products for pest control services, agro-industrial companies, or environmental organizations.

-   **Advanced Analytics and Data Science:**
    -   **Geospatial Analysis:** Write scripts to build disease vector distribution maps by processing geotagged images.
    -   **Predictive Modeling:** Use the library's outputs as features for larger models that forecast disease outbreaks based on vector presence and density.
